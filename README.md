btn
===

btn is a Mac app that connects to a physical, Arduino based, button via USB. 

Users can select a number of actions to take when the button is pressed, such as launching application(s), opening URL(s) or executing a shell script. 

Currently btn can only communicate over USB, but in the future I would like to extend it's functionality to allow WiFi communication between the Arduino and Mac, allowing btn to work wirelessly.
